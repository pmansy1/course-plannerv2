ASEM 2513 Constructing Freedom and Bondage (4 Credits),"Historically, claims about what it means to be free -- or even human -- have been made through discourses about enslavement and imprisonment; some have used bondage as a trope to explore philosophical or artistic projects, while others have used it to interrogate the assumptions of various political and economic paradigms. Others, still, have used these tropes as a means of advocating for social change, notably through slavery and prison abolition movements. This course examines how writers such as Hegel, Frederick Douglass, Angela Davis, and Dylan Rodríguez define the relationship between freedom and bondage, and it examines the stakes of those definitions for an American ethos deeply invested in the concept of freedom.

ASEM 2648 Good Vibrations - Electronic Music: Technology and Culture (4 Credits),"This course hopes to supply the answer to the question, ""How did we get here?

In order to understand characteristics of electronic instruments, we start with traditional mechanical-acoustic instruments. Their characteristics are the model for many modern electronic instruments. Although in the experimental years early in the 20 th century, all traditional models of music were questioned; those included musical notation which has been in place since Charlemagne's rule in A. D. 800, the number of notes within an octave, the number of notes within a span of time, and dynamic range (loudness and softness). We look at the anatomy, physiology and perception (psychoacoustics) of human auditory response in order to frame the limits of the characteristics of electronic music and the means to produce them.

ASEM 2739 Can College Teach Reasoning? (4 Credits),"In the last several years, colleges and universities have made national news with a series of controversies over diversity, inclusivity, and free speech. Many commentators see free speech at odds with diversity and inclusivity. Those who stress the importance of free speech on campus often embrace an idea with a long philosophical history: the “thinking cure. ” According to this line of thinking, a principal task of education— particularly higher education—is to teach critical thinking. A well-functioning university (not to mention a well- functioning democracy) is a marketplace of ideas where participants are free to rationally debate the issues of the day. The best ideas will eventually win out. People need the skills to debate rationally, which education should provide, and the freedom to deploy those skills in arguing for their versions of the true and the good, which educational institutions and the courts should protect. This course aims to understand and critically analyze this line of thinking through the lens of philosophy, empirical psychology, and contemporary journalism. Can we really be trained to reason in the way that this line of thinking requires? The course considers arguments that emphasize the limitations on our ability to reason, arguments that we are frequently subject to (sometimes insuperable) biases. We examine how these arguments bear on the aims of education generally, and on free speech provisions in particular.",,,"a long philosophical history, a marketplace, a principal task, a series, a well-functioning university, aim, an idea, argument, bias, campus, college, commentator, contemporary journalism, controversy, court, critical thinking, cure, day, diversity, education, educational, educational institutions, empirical, empirical psychology, free, free speech, free speech provisions, freedom, good, high, idea, importance, inclusivity, institution, journalism, lens, limitation, line, long, many commentators, marketplace, national news, news, odd, our ability, participant, particular, particularly higher education, people, philosophical, philosophy, principal, provision, psychology, reason, series, speech, subject, task, the aims, the best ideas, the course, the courts, the day, the good, the importance, the issues, the last several years, the lens, the limitations, the skills, the way, the “thinking cure, their versions, these arguments, thinking, this course, this line, those skills, true, version, way, year",ASEM 2739,ASEM,4,Unknown

Literary Chinatown explores the intersection of history, geography, and literature through the myriad ways of Chinatown stories by major authors in Chinese American literature across the period from the early 20 th century until the contemporary moment. The focus lies on unraveling the intricate relationship between space, place, and identity, tracing the complexities of being Chinese in America at pivotal historical junctures that shed light on the U. S. nation-building process—its rejection, accommodation, and incorporation of Chinese lives. These literary works set the stage for examining the impact of war, imperialism, (neo)colonialism, and globalization on immigration, alongside domestic issues of race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We aim to unravel the Chinese American experience as portrayed in its literary recreations of Chinatown memory, fantasy, narrative, and myth within Chinese American literature.

This course approaches these questions by looking at various reflections on globalization and “empire. ” While reading literary works in the nineteenth century, when the British empire extended its reach and control over literally every time zone, we also put them in dialogue with contemporary reports, databases, and fiction. We ask: How did nineteenth-century British and Anglophone authors react to issues directly relevant to and caused by imperial expansion and globalization? And how have their reflections shaped the way we think about power and inequality today? Apart from writers frequently taught in courses on British literature, we will also read British authors who are, ironically, often not classified under “British” (such as Mary Prince, an abolitionist born a slave in Bermuda, and Mary Seacole, also a woman of color, who traveled widely and served as a military nurse during the Crimean War).

The waves of European settlers who followed Columbus not only forcefully settled Indigenous lands by dispossessing Native peoples, but enforced a series of spiritual, cultural, social, political, and economic changes that had devastating effects on Indigenous lifeways. Yet, Indigeneity continues to not only thrive but challenges the ongoing disruption caused by settler-colonial occupation of lands and lives. This course, which is the first of a three-part sequence, takes Indigeneity and its repression by settler-colonialism as a foundational structure that inaugurated other projects of global consequence, including (anti)Black slavery and European colonization of the “Old World. ” While Indigeneity is an international concept, our focus in this class will be on New World Indigeneity, especially North America.

ETHN 2202 1619: Slavery and Its Afterlives (1-2 Credits),"The year 1619 marked the arrival of the first slave ship on the shores of what would come to be known as the United States of America. In August of that year, an English ship reached Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula where 20 Black people were sold for food and other essentials. This event inaugurated what would soon become a foundational institution of the New World—anti-Black chattel slavery—which undergirded all aspects of life in the U. S. Even though slavery had existed in many forms and in many places across the globe, what the U. S. model of slavery succeeded in doing was linking slavery with Blackness. This made slavery an inescapable part of Blackness, ensuring that whoever was born Black was also born into slavery. The celebrated theorist Toni Morrison has called slavery “America’s original sin. ” Although slavery was formally abolished through the Emancipation Proclamation issued on Jan 1, 1863, it has continued to structure contemporary Black life, which the theorist Saidiya Hartman has termed the “aftermaths of slavery. ” In other words, for critical Black theorists such as Hartman, slavery never ended but transformed into other structures that continue to render Black lives disposable.

ETHN 2302 1848: Settler Colonialism to Settler Imperialism (1-2 Credits),"Description: 1848 marked the signing of the Treaty of Guadalope-Hidalgo between the U. S. and Mexico. Apart from ending the U. S. -Mexico war, the treaty forced Mexico to cede about half of its territory, including present-day states of Texas as well as California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and many other states. This makes it one of the largest land grabs in human history. More importantly, this treaty facilitated the westward expansion of settlers, leading to new forms of racial antagonisms while escalating existing ones. This class approaches this moment as also marking the emergence of the U. S. as an imperialist superpower on the world stage as its war making, which was hitherto focused exclusively on Indigenous groups, would now be expanded to new terrains and increasingly outside the New World. We will also pay attention to how colonial expropriation and racialization of Indigenous and Black people would provide the grammar that the U. S. would use as it encountered racial others both within its newly established but unstable borders as well as across the world.

FREN 2303 Victor Hugo: Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (4 Credits),"The course deals with two famous novels by Victor Hugo: Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Though written in the nineteenth century, these works explore themes that are relevant in contemporary society, like racism, sexism, injustice, marginalization, and poverty. Les Misérables is the story of a man, Jean Valjean, a victim of social injustice who redeems himself to become a generous humanitarian, saving himself and everyone around him. This novel explores many social issues and calls out for reform. Discrimination against women and their mistreatment by a paternalistic system is a major theme. The inhuman exploitation of the poor, the homeless, and the marginalized is another major subject. This exploitation can lead to extreme suffering for some people and to criminal behavior for others. Hugo emphasizes the influence of the spiritual in human life. Individuals, even emperors like Napoleon, are invited in different ways to respond to divine love, but some are more able to do so than others. Hugo wrote The Hunchback of Notre-Dame to inspire the French public to save the famous cathedral, almost destroyed recently, from demolition back in the 1830 s. He tells the story of Esmeralda, a beautiful, kindhearted, and talented young woman, who is a victim of discrimination and persecution because she is a woman and a person of color. She is loved by four men, each of whom contributes, wittingly or unwittingly, to her ultimate destruction. The cathedral itself and the Blessed Lady for whom it is named (Our Lady of Paris) are also major characters. The author shows that the same injustices, inequalities, and prejudices that he tried to combat in his own time already existed in the Middle Ages. Students will refine their critical reading and writing skills as well as substantially develop their argumentative skills.

ILLC 2100 Globalization: A View from Costa Rica (4 Credits),"Globalization"" is a widely used word these days; however, there is little agreement on what it means. The diverse use of ""globalization"" may range from utopian to dystopian, from a losing proposition for some to the winning streak for the others, from the ""civilizing power of free markets"" to the ""barbarism of state-controlled markets, "" from clash of civilizations to cosmopolitan ethics, from universally accepted values to honoring unique beliefs cherished by individuals, from protecting the rights of smaller countries to embracing a global order of a world government, from euphoric optimism to debilitating pessimism, from a melting pot of cultures to a loss of cultural identity--the list goes on and on. For all practical purposes though, globalization can be defined as the intensification of economic, political, legal, social and cultural interconnectedness across international borders (Paul, Roy and Mukhopadhyay, Journal of International Marketing, 2006). In this course, we examine this definition of globalization firsthand, by visiting Costa Rica. Costa Rica provides a perfect opportunity for studying the phenomenon of globalization. It is a close, sage and friendly country, yet quite different from the U. S. We learn about the similarities and dissimilarities in cultural, political, legal, social public policy, and economic systems that exist between Costa Rica and the U. S.

INTS 3420 Climate Security (4 Credits),"Since the dawn of agriculture (~7000 BCE), but rapidly accelerating in the industrial age (1750 CE to the present), humanity has conducted an uncontrolled experiment in bending the natural environment to fit human needs and desires. Despite the perceived distance that technology has placed between our physical environments and our daily lives, human interactions with our natural environment are still fundamental – and set to be disrupted by climate change, one of the most vexing issues of our time. It poses a wicked problem: a socio/cultural problem that is seemingly impossible to solve due to incomplete knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large changes required, and the linked nature of the problem with other major social issues and problems. Since the end of the Cold War, much attention has been paid to the role of natural resources and environmental scarcity as a source of conflict, ranging from “water wars” between states sharing a common river basin to communal conflict between pastoralists and farmers in the Sahel and even the Syrian Civil War.

INTS 2780 Global Corporate Responsibility and Accountability (4 Credits),"The course explores the role of corporate responsibility and accountability in a global context. Neoliberal globalization characterized by free trade has greatly expanded the role of global corporations in most countries. The practices and behavior of corporations are determining the quality of life for people throughout the globe. Yet there are few rules and laws that govern corporations on a global scale. While a corporation may exhibit social and environmental responsibility and respect human rights in one country, it may be a different matter altogether in the Global South where there are fewer restrictions on corporate behavior. Transnational corporations increasingly recognize that engaging in good practices to improve lives and communities extends beyond ethical and moral considerations. In many cases, corporations have been forced to change practices due to actions by civil society and governments. These actions have meant that corporations must consider monetary and reputational risks when considering the effects of their operations. These risks are increasingly built into business models to reduce expected and unexpected costs of community resistance and civil unrest. This has resulted in the “business case for global corporate responsibility. ” Against this backdrop are charges by NGOs and labor unions of corporations engaging in “greenwashing” and “blue-washing. ” The course seeks to expose students to various forms of corporate responsibility and accountability together with several global goverce systems. The course will be useful to those students who are concerned about the ethics of global corporate investment and may want to work inside a transnational company. The course will also appeal to those who want to affect change through government or civil society organizations. It will also be advantageous to those interested in pursuing further study in this area.

INTS 3425 Political Psychology (4 Credits),"Political psychology provides an important lens for studying and understanding political phenomena and global patterns. It maintains that the study of individuals and groups is essential for understanding political behavior, and such study must go beyond rational actor assumptions to an understanding of how individuals and groups behave in political contexts and what influences this behavior. Political decisions and actions are ultimately taken by individual actors, whether they be leaders, elites, or average citizens. This course will explore this important area of theory and research lying at the intersection of several fields – psychology and political science of course, but also sociology, anthropology, organizational studies, and even neuroscience.

JUST 2014 Religious Existentialism: Christian and Jewish (4 Credits),"Existentialism focuses on the human experience of living, often with a focus on the sheer freedom of the human condition. Religious existentialism subtly modifies this picture through its own vision of human freedom as the ultimate encounter between the human subject and God (with 'God' understood in various ways). The religious existentialist in this sense philosophically explores that which is most-fully-human as a moment of relation and encounter between self and that which is beyond self. Starting with Sartre's non-religious statement of existentialism in Existentialism is a Humanism (1946), we go on to examine the Christian and Jewish existentialisms of Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Tillich (1886-1965), Buber (1878-1965), and Heschel (1907-1972).

PHYS 3350 Physics and Information (4 Credits),"Students in Physical Sciences are often well versed in the art of model building but less so in the process of model-selection when multiple models can describe the same data. Students rarely learn tools beyond curve fitting and least square error minimization for model selection. Consequently, students are often unaware of the scope of different tools and fail to make judicious choice of algorithms/theories when faced with diverse problems. For example, building a model from data is very different from generating data (stochastic or deterministic) from a model. Next consider two contrasting challenges of model building i) when there is limited data vs ii) when there is too much data. For the first problem -- inferring models from limited data -- the solution can be traced back to Boltzmann's formulation of Statistical Physics describing motion of atoms. The connection between Information theory, Inference and Boltzmann's description, however, is often overlooked in introductory or even advanced classes in Physics, and Statistics. Studying these similarities can unlock novel solutions for problems well outside of thermodynamics, even as far as Image processing, Biology and Network science. Inference also requires us to appreciate fundamental topics in Probability -- difference between frequentist and non-frequentist approach, Bayesian formalism -- that are rarely taught to physical scientists, life scientists or engineers. At the other extreme, faced with data deluge, we routinely ask: how do we make sense of too much data ? We use clustering, PCA, Neural Networks. In this course we will discuss and connect all these seemingly disparate concepts and apply them -- at the appropriate context -- to diverse problems in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and beyond. In the process we will gain an in-depth knowledge about commonly heard but perhaps less understood topics such as: Entropy, Likelihood maximization, Bayesian statistics, PCA, Classification algorithms, and Neural Networks. We will also address another often overlooked but fundamental and fascinating topic, biology's inherent ability to encode and decode information. Currently there is no such course that address all these topics in Information and Data Science in an unified manner -- deeply connecting their formal basis, regime of applicability -- grounded on physical principles, with a forward looking approach towards application in many areas well outside of traditional sciences. A lot of learning in the course will happen `on the fly', where the tools and application problems are learnt as needed. Prerequisites: Calculus I, Calculus II, and at least two other courses focusing on application of mathematics to problems in physics/chemistry/biology or engineering. Example of this course can be University Physics, Modern Physics, Biostatistics, Differential Equation, Linear Algebra, Computational Physics, or other equivalent courses (upon Instructor approval).",,,", pca, -frequentist approach, a forward looking approach, a lot, a model, algebra, algorithm, all these seemingly disparate concepts, all these topics, an unified manner, another often overlooked but fundamental and fascinating topic, applicability, application problems, appropriate, art, at least two other courses, atom, basis, bayesian, bayesian formalism, bayesian statistics, biology, biology's inherent ability, biostatistic, boltzmann, boltzmann's description, boltzmann's formulation, building, calculus, calculus i, calculus ii, challenge, chemistry, choice, classification, computational, computational physics, connection, curve, curve fitting and least square error minimization, data deluge, decode, deluge, depth, description, difference, different tools, differential, differential equation, disparate, diverse, diverse problems, engineer, engineering, entropy, equation, equivalent, error, example, extreme, fascinating, fitting, fly, formal, formalism, formulation, forward, frequentist, fundamental topics, image, image processing, inference, inferring, inferring models, information, information and data science, information theory, inherent, introductory, introductory or even advanced classes, judicious, judicious choice, learning, life, life scientists, likelihood, likelihood maximization, limited, limited data, linear, linear algebra, lot, manner, many areas, mathematic, maximization, minimization, model building, model selection, modern, modern physics, motion, multiple, multiple models, network, neural, neural networks, no such course, non, novel, novel solutions, other equivalent courses, pca, physic, physical, physical principles, physical sciences, physical scientists, physics, probability, processing, regime, science, scientist, scope, selection, sense, similarity, solution, square, statistic, statistical, statistical physics, the appropriate context, the art, the connection, the course, the first problem, the fly, the other extreme, the process, the same data, the scope, the solution, the tools, their formal basis, thermodynamic, these similarities, this course, to encode and decode information, too much data, tool, traditional, traditional sciences, two contrasting challenges, unaware, unified, university physics",PHYS 3350,PHYS,4,Advanced

Rather, the emergence of monotheism was a multi-stage process spanning several millennia and involving numerous religious traditions, primarily Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This process was marked by internal and external conflict, as individuals and communities struggled to distinguish themselves from their non-monotheistic predecessors and neighbors, while often attempting to convince others to do the same. In this class, we begin with the ancient Near Eastern religious environment in which the idea of monotheism first appeared, then turn our attention to how the movement toward monotheism shapes the texts of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran.

How has the translation of European literature into Japanese impacted Japanese literary aesthetics and vice versa?

THEA 2230 Movement and Voice for Actors (4 Credits),"Actors often learn movement and vocal training separately, despite the fact that speaking is a physical act and that an actor’s voice and body are constantly working in relationship to each other. This course has two main objectives: 1) to train your actor instrument through rigorous physical and vocal training, and 2) to help you understand the essential and dynamic relationship between an actor’s breath, body, and voice. You’ll explore how physical actor training strengthens and improves the ability to speak while ultimately allowing you to embody a character more successfully. Drawing from many areas of study in movement and voice, you will connect physical and vocal action through a series of exercises and explorations. Specifically, we’ll investigate 1) how to prepare your body for performance circumstances and to successfully support your vocal needs, and 2) how your body and voice can work symbiotically during performance to deliver a more powerful, precise, engaging performance. The course will begin with extensive physical and vocal actor training; then we’ll apply this training to specific theatrical texts; it will culminate in a collaborative performance that will provide opportunities for both individual and group performances. This work will strengthen stage presence and characterization and will heighten your emotional and physical power and commitment to each moment onstage.

Students will be encouraged to critically explore topics from courses they have taken in Black Studies and related disciplines as topics for their capstone research projects.",BLST3600,,"a capstone project, a collaborative learning process, a form, africa, african, all course, america, american, americas, an original capstone project, analytical, aspect, atlantic, atlantic slavery, black, black america, black studies, black studies minors, black/african american life, broadly defined themes, capstone, capstone project topics, clear, clear project objectives, collaborative, creative, creative capstone projects, critical intellectual interventions, denver, disciplinary, disciplinary and interdisciplinary methodologies, each student, effect, europe, experience, form, freedom, gender, goal, humanity, intellectual, intensive, intensive research, intervention, learning, life, major issues, material, methodology, objective, original, primary, related, related disciplines, science, sexuality, slavery, social sciences, some aspect, standard, states, struggle, synthesis, the americas, the capstone projects, the effects, the field, the humanities, the minor, the primary goal, the standard written thesis model, the united states, the university, their analytical skills, their capstone research projects, their own design, their research materials, their skills, their study, their work, theme, thesis, this capstone course, this course, united, woman",WRIT 3600,WRIT,4,Unknown
WRIT 1022 English for Academic Purposes (4 Credits),"This 4-credit course is designed to facilitate the acquisition of US English for Academic Purposes (EAP) by multilingual students who use English as an additional language. In this class, students will be immersed into the academic world that the University of Denver participates in, to develop proficiency in usage conventions while paying attention to the reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills that are necessary for a student’s holistic participation in diverse academic cultures. In addition to classroom instruction and working in the language lab, we will spend a significant amount of time interacting with the community around DU to gain experience communicating in different contexts and rhetorical situations. Students are encouraged to use all resources (including languages they are proficient in) available to them as they work to improve their EAP proficiency.",,,"a significant amount, a student’s holistic participation, academic purposes, acquisition, addition, additional, all resources, an additional language, attention, available, classroom, classroom instruction, communicating, convention, denver, different contexts, diverse, diverse academic cultures, eap, english, experience, experience communicating, holistic, instruction, lab, language, listening, multilingual, multilingual students, necessary, participation, proficiency, purpose, reading, resource, rhetorical, rhetorical situations, significant, situation, the academic world, the acquisition, the community, the language lab, the reading, the university, their eap proficiency, this 4-credit course, this class, time, usage, usage conventions, writing",WRIT 1022,WRIT,4,Unknown
