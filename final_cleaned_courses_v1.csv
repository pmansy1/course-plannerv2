However, this collection of stories has also significantly contributed to how the West views the Middle East: an exotic world populated by negative images such as conniving and manipulating harem women and violent and unscrupulous Arab men. The Tales of the Arabian Nights provide a unique platform for the discussion of current issues such as orientalism, stereotyping, and gender discrimination. In this course, we will select a handful of stories to serve as a catalyst for inquiry to show how this shared narrative passed on from generation to generation, has contributed to the creation of an ‘exotic’ East invented by the colonial West. We will show that the Middle East, like the rest of the world, is in a state of flux and the text is not a historical account of the medieval Arab world and cannot be viewed a-historically. We will unveil all the stereotypes that have been subtly, or not so subtly, implanted in the mind of the west through an often-erroneous portrayal of the Arab world. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",,,doubt magical transformation marvelous plot story arabian night know thousand night great entertainment value imaginary setting tale fascinate inspire author artist collection story significantly contribute west view middle east exotic world populate negative image connive manipulate harem woman violent unscrupulous arab man tale arabian night provide unique platform discussion current issue orientalism stereotyping gender discrimination course select handful story serve catalyst inquiry shared narrative pass generation generation contribute creation exotic east invent colonial west middle east like rest world state flux text historical account medieval arab world view historically unveil stereotype subtly subtly implant mind west erroneous portrayal arab world course count analytical inquiry society culture requirement,ARAB 1351,ARAB

Our key question is “What is the best way to understand or construe this relationship? ” We begin by attempting to identify and, then, dispel certain popular “myths” about science and religion. Then we turn our attention to the life, the scientific discoveries, the religious commitments and struggles of Charles Darwin. Darwin’s career is the perfect entry point for considering much broader issues in the relationship between science and religion. Darwin’s evolutionary theory fundamentally shaped modern science. But in so doing it also raised significant challenges to traditional religious belief, particularly in Christian communities of faith. For that reason, Darwin is as controversial today as he was 150 years ago, especially in (tho’ not limited to) America. With that foundation, we shall be in a position to wrestle with a quite recent, thorough-going reassessment of the science/religion debate, one that is both critical and constructive.

ASEM 2450 Settler Colonialism: Pasts/Presents/Futures (4 Credits),"Informed by work in critical indigenous studies, this course examines settler colonialism as a particular form of colonialism which is not a phenomena of the past but one that is central to the organization of contemporary society. Starting with the theft of indigenous lands, settlers unleashed processes that have had far-reaching impact across several domains. These range from altering the sexual organization of the family and the economic organization of society to the use of technologies and processes developed against indigenous people to oppress non-indigenous racial and other minorities. This class explores all these phenomena starting with the profound life-altering impact that settler-colonialism has for indigenous people and then branches out to explore the place of settlers, non-indigenous people of color, and other minorities in the settler-colonial matrix. Furthermore, the class explores settler colonialism as a transnational phenomenon by looking at other settler-colonial sites such as Palestine/Israel, Australia, and New Zealand, among others. The course ends by considering decolonization as a politics that is committed to indigenous liberation and as an ethic that is both incommensurable with other political projects but can also profoundly transform them.

ASEM 2513 Constructing Freedom and Bondage (4 Credits),"Historically, claims about what it means to be free -- or even human -- have been made through discourses about enslavement and imprisonment; some have used bondage as a trope to explore philosophical or artistic projects, while others have used it to interrogate the assumptions of various political and economic paradigms. Others, still, have used these tropes as a means of advocating for social change, notably through slavery and prison abolition movements. This course examines how writers such as Hegel, Frederick Douglass, Angela Davis, and Dylan Rodríguez define the relationship between freedom and bondage, and it examines the stakes of those definitions for an American ethos deeply invested in the concept of freedom. The course uses frameworks of critical discourse analysis to consider peer-reviewed scholarship, political speeches, reality TV, music videos, and documentary films.

ASEM 2648 Good Vibrations - Electronic Music: Technology and Culture (4 Credits),"This course hopes to supply the answer to the question, ""How did we get here? "" To answer that question, we need to look at the phenomenon from many different perspectives. History frames the topics of the course. In order to understand characteristics of electronic instruments, we start with traditional mechanical-acoustic instruments. Their characteristics are the model for many modern electronic instruments. Although in the experimental years early in the 20 th century, all traditional models of music were questioned; those included musical notation which has been in place since Charlemagne's rule in A. D. 800, the number of notes within an octave, the number of notes within a span of time, and dynamic range (loudness and softness). We look at the anatomy, physiology and perception (psychoacoustics) of human auditory response in order to frame the limits of the characteristics of electronic music and the means to produce them. Of course, the ""electronics"" are presented at a higher system level to promote understanding of the electronic instruments themselves.

ASEM 2739 Can College Teach Reasoning? (4 Credits),"In the last several years, colleges and universities have made national news with a series of controversies over diversity, inclusivity, and free speech. Many commentators see free speech at odds with diversity and inclusivity. Those who stress the importance of free speech on campus often embrace an idea with a long philosophical history: the “thinking cure. ” According to this line of thinking, a principal task of education— particularly higher education—is to teach critical thinking. A well-functioning university (not to mention a well- functioning democracy) is a marketplace of ideas where participants are free to rationally debate the issues of the day. The best ideas will eventually win out. People need the skills to debate rationally, which education should provide, and the freedom to deploy those skills in arguing for their versions of the true and the good, which educational institutions and the courts should protect. This course aims to understand and critically analyze this line of thinking through the lens of philosophy, empirical psychology, and contemporary journalism. Can we really be trained to reason in the way that this line of thinking requires? The course considers arguments that emphasize the limitations on our ability to reason, arguments that we are frequently subject to (sometimes insuperable) biases. We examine how these arguments bear on the aims of education generally, and on free speech provisions in particular.",,,year college university national news series controversy diversity inclusivity free speech commentator free speech odd diversity inclusivity stress importance free speech campus embrace idea long philosophical history thinking cure accord line think principal task education particularly high education teach critical thinking function university mention function democracy marketplace idea participant free rationally debate issue day good idea eventually win people need skill debate rationally education provide freedom deploy skill argue version true good educational institution court protect course aim understand critically analyze line think lens philosophy empirical psychology contemporary journalism train reason way line thinking require course consider argument emphasize limitation ability reason argument frequently subject insuperable bias examine argument bear aim education generally free speech provision particular,ASEM 2739,ASEM

CHIN 2516 Literary Chinatown: Stories of Chinese in America (4 Credits),"As the oldest diasporic enclave of Chinese in the United States, Chinatown has been both a physical and historical site where Chinese immigrants have built a community and a continually contested symbolic space represented in Chinese American literature. Literary Chinatown explores the intersection of history, geography, and literature through the myriad ways of Chinatown stories by major authors in Chinese American literature across the period from the early 20 th century until the contemporary moment. The focus lies on unraveling the intricate relationship between space, place, and identity, tracing the complexities of being Chinese in America at pivotal historical junctures that shed light on the U. S. nation-building process—its rejection, accommodation, and incorporation of Chinese lives. These literary works set the stage for examining the impact of war, imperialism, (neo)colonialism, and globalization on immigration, alongside domestic issues of race, class, gender, and ethnicity. We aim to unravel the Chinese American experience as portrayed in its literary recreations of Chinatown memory, fantasy, narrative, and myth within Chinese American literature. We also brought scholarly discourse on the intersectional and comparative approaches to the study of race, culture, politics, and place in Chinese American literature.

This course approaches these questions by looking at various reflections on globalization and “empire. ” While reading literary works in the nineteenth century, when the British empire extended its reach and control over literally every time zone, we also put them in dialogue with contemporary reports, databases, and fiction. We ask: How did nineteenth-century British and Anglophone authors react to issues directly relevant to and caused by imperial expansion and globalization? And how have their reflections shaped the way we think about power and inequality today? Apart from writers frequently taught in courses on British literature, we will also read British authors who are, ironically, often not classified under “British” (such as Mary Prince, an abolitionist born a slave in Bermuda, and Mary Seacole, also a woman of color, who traveled widely and served as a military nurse during the Crimean War).

"ETHN 2102 1492: Indigeneity, Settler Colonialism, Race (1-2 Credits)","The year 1492 inaugurated a profoundly destructive phase in the history of humanity, but more so for the Indigenous peoples of this hemisphere as Christopher Columbus arrived at the shores of the “New World. ” Within a couple of centuries after his arrival, thriving Indigenous civilizations found themselves in dire straits, if not completely laid to waste, causing untold suffering to the original inhabitants of this continent. The waves of European settlers who followed Columbus not only forcefully settled Indigenous lands by dispossessing Native peoples, but enforced a series of spiritual, cultural, social, political, and economic changes that had devastating effects on Indigenous lifeways. Yet, Indigeneity continues to not only thrive but challenges the ongoing disruption caused by settler-colonial occupation of lands and lives. This course, which is the first of a three-part sequence, takes Indigeneity and its repression by settler-colonialism as a foundational structure that inaugurated other projects of global consequence, including (anti)Black slavery and European colonization of the “Old World. ” While Indigeneity is an international concept, our focus in this class will be on New World Indigeneity, especially North America. We will approach settler colonialism not as a thing of the past but as an ongoing incursion into the lives of Indigenous people, who continue to challenge it in new and innovative ways.",,,year inaugurate profoundly destructive phase history humanity indigenous people hemisphere christopher columbus arrive shore new world couple century arrival thrive indigenous civilization find dire strait completely lay waste cause untold suffering original inhabitant continent wave european settler follow columbus forcefully settle indigenous land dispossess native people enforce series spiritual cultural social political economic change devastating effect indigenous lifeway indigeneity continue thrive challenge ongoing disruption cause settler colonial occupation land live course sequence take indigeneity repression settler colonialism foundational structure inaugurate project global consequence include anti black slavery european colonization old world indigeneity international concept focus class new world indigeneity especially north america approach settler colonialism thing past ongoing incursion life indigenous people continue challenge new innovative way,ETHN 2102,ETHN

ETHN 2202 1619: Slavery and Its Afterlives (1-2 Credits),"The year 1619 marked the arrival of the first slave ship on the shores of what would come to be known as the United States of America. In August of that year, an English ship reached Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula where 20 Black people were sold for food and other essentials. This event inaugurated what would soon become a foundational institution of the New World—anti-Black chattel slavery—which undergirded all aspects of life in the U. S. Even though slavery had existed in many forms and in many places across the globe, what the U. S. model of slavery succeeded in doing was linking slavery with Blackness. This made slavery an inescapable part of Blackness, ensuring that whoever was born Black was also born into slavery. The celebrated theorist Toni Morrison has called slavery “America’s original sin. ” Although slavery was formally abolished through the Emancipation Proclamation issued on Jan 1, 1863, it has continued to structure contemporary Black life, which the theorist Saidiya Hartman has termed the “aftermaths of slavery. ” In other words, for critical Black theorists such as Hartman, slavery never ended but transformed into other structures that continue to render Black lives disposable. This class embraces Hartman’s understanding of slavery as an institution that has survived in (c)overt forms, as critical to understanding contemporary issues faced by Black people.",,As critical to understanding; S understanding,year mark arrival slave ship shore come know united states america august year english ship reach point comfort virginia peninsula black people sell food essential event inaugurate soon foundational institution new world anti black chattel slavery undergird aspect life slavery exist form place globe model slavery succeed link slavery blackness slavery inescapable blackness ensure bear black bear slavery celebrate theorist toni morrison call slavery america original sin slavery formally abolish emancipation proclamation issue jan continue structure contemporary black life theorist saidiya hartman term aftermath slavery word critical black theorist hartman slavery end transform structure continue render black life disposable class embrace hartman understanding slavery institution survive overt form critical understand contemporary issue face black people,ETHN 2202,ETHN

ETHN 2302 1848: Settler Colonialism to Settler Imperialism (1-2 Credits),"Description: 1848 marked the signing of the Treaty of Guadalope-Hidalgo between the U. S. and Mexico. Apart from ending the U. S. -Mexico war, the treaty forced Mexico to cede about half of its territory, including present-day states of Texas as well as California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, parts of Colorado, and many other states. This makes it one of the largest land grabs in human history. More importantly, this treaty facilitated the westward expansion of settlers, leading to new forms of racial antagonisms while escalating existing ones. This class approaches this moment as also marking the emergence of the U. S. as an imperialist superpower on the world stage as its war making, which was hitherto focused exclusively on Indigenous groups, would now be expanded to new terrains and increasingly outside the New World. We will also pay attention to how colonial expropriation and racialization of Indigenous and Black people would provide the grammar that the U. S. would use as it encountered racial others both within its newly established but unstable borders as well as across the world. In sum, this class will explore different antagonisms that comprise the ""cacophony of empire"" (Byrd, 2011) and how racialized groups have fought back as well as remained complicit in reinscribing the supremacy of the U. S.",,,description mark signing treaty guadalope hidalgo mexico apart end mexico war treaty force mexico cede half territory include present day state texas california nevada utah new mexico part colorado state make large land grab human history importantly treaty facilitate westward expansion settler lead new form racial antagonism escalate exist one class approach moment mark emergence imperialist superpower world stage war making hitherto focus exclusively indigenous group expand new terrain increasingly outside new world pay attention colonial expropriation racialization indigenous black people provide grammar use encounter racial newly establish unstable border world sum class explore different antagonism comprise cacophony empire byrd racialize group fight remain complicit reinscribe supremacy,ETHN 2302,ETHN

Emotional Intelligence (EI) can be confusing. What does it mean? Is it fluffy stuff or something really tangible? Now more than ever, employers and clients are seeking leaders who display emotionally intelligent thinking, decision making and actions. How do you know if you meet those requirements? Up until recently, EI was a “gut assessment” of someone’s ability to control their emotions or care about someone or something. Now, we have a valid and reliable way of understanding our emotional intelligence and that of others. We can even measure the EI of teams! It turns out EI is quite complex. Research has distinguished 12 components of EI including: self regard, self actualization, self awareness, emotional expression, assertiveness, independence, interpersonal relationships, empathy, social responsibility, problem solving, reality testing, impulse control, flexibility, stress tolerance and optimism. Want to know how you score in these areas? EI is a “talent” that, unlike IQ, can be learned and improved throughout one’s life.

FREN 2303 Victor Hugo: Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (4 Credits),"The course deals with two famous novels by Victor Hugo: Les Misérables and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Though written in the nineteenth century, these works explore themes that are relevant in contemporary society, like racism, sexism, injustice, marginalization, and poverty. Les Misérables is the story of a man, Jean Valjean, a victim of social injustice who redeems himself to become a generous humanitarian, saving himself and everyone around him. This novel explores many social issues and calls out for reform. Discrimination against women and their mistreatment by a paternalistic system is a major theme. The inhuman exploitation of the poor, the homeless, and the marginalized is another major subject. This exploitation can lead to extreme suffering for some people and to criminal behavior for others. Hugo emphasizes the influence of the spiritual in human life. Individuals, even emperors like Napoleon, are invited in different ways to respond to divine love, but some are more able to do so than others. Hugo wrote The Hunchback of Notre-Dame to inspire the French public to save the famous cathedral, almost destroyed recently, from demolition back in the 1830 s. He tells the story of Esmeralda, a beautiful, kindhearted, and talented young woman, who is a victim of discrimination and persecution because she is a woman and a person of color. She is loved by four men, each of whom contributes, wittingly or unwittingly, to her ultimate destruction. The cathedral itself and the Blessed Lady for whom it is named (Our Lady of Paris) are also major characters. The author shows that the same injustices, inequalities, and prejudices that he tried to combat in his own time already existed in the Middle Ages. Students will refine their critical reading and writing skills as well as substantially develop their argumentative skills.

Each week, we will look at the history of a different sport, including cricket, tennis, soccer, golf, rugby, and hockey, and explore the intersection of race, class, and gender in how these sports were played and transformed in the imperial world. We will consider the ways in which sport was used not only as an element of the racialized “civilizing” mission of imperial ventures, but also how sport was coopted by indigenous populations to resist colonial structures of segregation and oppression. This class will ask us to reconsider the intersections and divergences in the way sports are both played and viewed by national sporting teams, local leagues and schools, and transmitted to audiences through live viewing, television, radio, and other forms of media. We will also look at the representations of sports and colonialism through films, fiction, and television shows.

ILLC 2100 Globalization: A View from Costa Rica (4 Credits),"Globalization"" is a widely used word these days; however, there is little agreement on what it means. The diverse use of ""globalization"" may range from utopian to dystopian, from a losing proposition for some to the winning streak for the others, from the ""civilizing power of free markets"" to the ""barbarism of state-controlled markets, "" from clash of civilizations to cosmopolitan ethics, from universally accepted values to honoring unique beliefs cherished by individuals, from protecting the rights of smaller countries to embracing a global order of a world government, from euphoric optimism to debilitating pessimism, from a melting pot of cultures to a loss of cultural identity--the list goes on and on. For all practical purposes though, globalization can be defined as the intensification of economic, political, legal, social and cultural interconnectedness across international borders (Paul, Roy and Mukhopadhyay, Journal of International Marketing, 2006). In this course, we examine this definition of globalization firsthand, by visiting Costa Rica. Costa Rica provides a perfect opportunity for studying the phenomenon of globalization. It is a close, sage and friendly country, yet quite different from the U. S. We learn about the similarities and dissimilarities in cultural, political, legal, social public policy, and economic systems that exist between Costa Rica and the U. S. We investigate the impact of globalization in Costa Rica and compare that with our experience in the U. S. Course activities include visits to local businesses, service learning projects with local schools and environmental groups, and guest speeches by government officials.",,,globalization widely word day little agreement mean diverse use globalization range utopian dystopian lose proposition win streak civilizing power free market barbarism state control market clash civilization cosmopolitan ethic universally accept value honor unique belief cherish individual protect right small country embrace global order world government euphoric optimism debilitate pessimism melting pot culture loss cultural identity list go practical purpose globalization define intensification economic political legal social cultural interconnectedness international border paul roy mukhopadhyay journal international marketing course examine definition globalization firsthand visit costa rica costa rica provide perfect opportunity study phenomenon globalization close sage friendly country different learn similarity dissimilarity cultural political legal social public policy economic system exist costa rica investigate impact globalization costa rica compare experience course activity include visit local business service learn project local school environmental group guest speech government official,ILLC 2100,ILLC

INTS 3420 Climate Security (4 Credits),"Since the dawn of agriculture (~7000 BCE), but rapidly accelerating in the industrial age (1750 CE to the present), humanity has conducted an uncontrolled experiment in bending the natural environment to fit human needs and desires. Despite the perceived distance that technology has placed between our physical environments and our daily lives, human interactions with our natural environment are still fundamental – and set to be disrupted by climate change, one of the most vexing issues of our time. It poses a wicked problem: a socio/cultural problem that is seemingly impossible to solve due to incomplete knowledge, the number of people and opinions involved, the large changes required, and the linked nature of the problem with other major social issues and problems. Since the end of the Cold War, much attention has been paid to the role of natural resources and environmental scarcity as a source of conflict, ranging from “water wars” between states sharing a common river basin to communal conflict between pastoralists and farmers in the Sahel and even the Syrian Civil War. This course will survey the impacts of climate change on livelihoods and human security, evaluate the expanding literature on environmental impacts on conflict, and address the emerging role of environmental stressors and climate change as US national security issues.

The design process is the same whether you are writing a short class research paper, or are conducting a major research project, such as a thesis. The manner in which evidence is gathered and analyzed, however, will vary based upon the research question, research goals, and resources. We will therefore go through the process of research design.

Indeed, John Quincy Adams, in 1821, warned the United States of the dangers of ""going abroad in search of monsters to destroy. "" In September of 2002, however, as American forces occupied one country and prepared to invade another, the Bush Administration released its National Security Strategy of the United States, which states: ""To contend with uncertainty and to meet the many challenges we face, the United States will require bases and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for long-distance deployment of U. S. forces. "" How did we go from isolation to empire? In this course, we will attempt to answer this question by exploring the progression of American foreign policy from its emergence out of isolation to its current stage of interventionist superpower. We will also identify and discuss key issues that are driving America's conduct abroad as well as evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the given policies addressing these important issues. By the end of the class, students should have a solid knowledge of the major themes and developments in the history of American foreign policy as well as the ability to reflect critically upon on-going foreign policy debates.",,,united states win independence leader seek avoid cost countless problem await country engage foreign affair john quincy adams warn united states danger go abroad search monster destroy september american force occupy country prepare invade bush administration release national security strategy united states state contend uncertainty meet challenge face united states require basis station western europe northeast asia temporary access arrangement long distance deployment force isolation empire course attempt answer question explore progression american foreign policy emergence isolation current stage interventionist superpower identify discuss key issue drive america conduct abroad evaluate strength weakness give policy address important issue end class student solid knowledge major theme development history american foreign policy ability reflect critically go foreign policy debate,INTS 2708,INTS

INTS 2780 Global Corporate Responsibility and Accountability (4 Credits),"The course explores the role of corporate responsibility and accountability in a global context. Neoliberal globalization characterized by free trade has greatly expanded the role of global corporations in most countries. The practices and behavior of corporations are determining the quality of life for people throughout the globe. Yet there are few rules and laws that govern corporations on a global scale. While a corporation may exhibit social and environmental responsibility and respect human rights in one country, it may be a different matter altogether in the Global South where there are fewer restrictions on corporate behavior. Transnational corporations increasingly recognize that engaging in good practices to improve lives and communities extends beyond ethical and moral considerations. In many cases, corporations have been forced to change practices due to actions by civil society and governments. These actions have meant that corporations must consider monetary and reputational risks when considering the effects of their operations. These risks are increasingly built into business models to reduce expected and unexpected costs of community resistance and civil unrest. This has resulted in the “business case for global corporate responsibility. ” Against this backdrop are charges by NGOs and labor unions of corporations engaging in “greenwashing” and “blue-washing. ” The course seeks to expose students to various forms of corporate responsibility and accountability together with several global goverce systems. The course will be useful to those students who are concerned about the ethics of global corporate investment and may want to work inside a transnational company. The course will also appeal to those who want to affect change through government or civil society organizations. It will also be advantageous to those interested in pursuing further study in this area. Finally, third party social auditing of transnational corporations is expanding, and the course provides some insights on work in this area.",,,course explore role corporate responsibility accountability global context neoliberal globalization characterize free trade greatly expand role global corporation country practice behavior corporation determine quality life people globe rule law govern corporation global scale corporation exhibit social environmental responsibility respect human right country different matter altogether global south few restriction corporate behavior transnational corporation increasingly recognize engage good practice improve life community extend ethical moral consideration case corporation force change practice action civil society government action mean corporation consider monetary reputational risk consider effect operation risk increasingly build business model reduce expect unexpected cost community resistance civil unrest result business case global corporate responsibility backdrop charge ngo labor union corporation engage greenwashe blue wash course seek expose student form corporate responsibility accountability global goverce system course useful student concerned ethic global corporate investment want work inside transnational company course appeal want affect change government civil society organization advantageous interested pursue study area finally party social auditing transnational corporation expand course provide insight work area,INTS 2780,INTS
INTS 3425 Political Psychology (4 Credits),"Political psychology provides an important lens for studying and understanding political phenomena and global patterns. It maintains that the study of individuals and groups is essential for understanding political behavior, and such study must go beyond rational actor assumptions to an understanding of how individuals and groups behave in political contexts and what influences this behavior. Political decisions and actions are ultimately taken by individual actors, whether they be leaders, elites, or average citizens. This course will explore this important area of theory and research lying at the intersection of several fields – psychology and political science of course, but also sociology, anthropology, organizational studies, and even neuroscience. Why do we see a rise in populism across many countries? How do atrocities and genocides occur? Why is developing peaceful and multicultural societies so difficult? How is voter choice influenced? Why do leaders do what they do? What does security actually mean to people? How is reconciliation achieved? The course will use a combination of readings, case studies, and discussions to enhance class members’ understanding and appreciation of the central concepts, theories, research methods, and applications of political psychology.",,And such study must go beyond rational actor assumptions to an understanding; It maintains that the study of individuals and groups is essential for understanding; Political psychology provides an important lens for studying and understanding; Understanding,political psychology provide important lens study understand political phenomenon global pattern maintain study individual group essential understand political behavior study rational actor assumption understanding individual group behave political context influence behavior political decision action ultimately take individual actor leader elite average citizen course explore important area theory research lie intersection field psychology political science course sociology anthropology organizational study neuroscience rise populism country atrocity genocide occur develop peaceful multicultural society difficult voter choice influence leader security actually mean people reconciliation achieve course use combination reading case study discussion enhance class member understanding appreciation central concept theorie research method application political psychology,INTS 3425,INTS

JUST 2014 Religious Existentialism: Christian and Jewish (4 Credits),"Existentialism focuses on the human experience of living, often with a focus on the sheer freedom of the human condition. Religious existentialism subtly modifies this picture through its own vision of human freedom as the ultimate encounter between the human subject and God (with 'God' understood in various ways). The religious existentialist in this sense philosophically explores that which is most-fully-human as a moment of relation and encounter between self and that which is beyond self. Starting with Sartre's non-religious statement of existentialism in Existentialism is a Humanism (1946), we go on to examine the Christian and Jewish existentialisms of Kierkegaard (1813-1855), Tillich (1886-1965), Buber (1878-1965), and Heschel (1907-1972). In the course of our reflections, we compare non-religious with religious approaches to basic questions about self, God and world, and we consider the relationship between Christian and Jewish existentialist approaches to these questions.

The New Testament are read as a collection of primary documents that chronicle the primitive Church's slow and often painful process of self-definition. In these writings it is possible to discern the tension that arose because of the strong religious and cultural ties early Christianity maintained with Palestinian Judaism, from which it emerged as a sectarian or reform movement. The careful reader also finds evidence of the new religion's encounter with the Greco-Roman world from whose variegated ethos and culture it borrowed considerably on the way to becoming an important religious force in the first century.

MUAC 3023 Rhythm & Meter in Music (4 Credits),"Rhythm pertains to experienced or measured durations in music. Meter pertains to the cyclic organization of music’s durations. A hegemonic view of meter emerged in music theory and related disciplines in the mid-20 th century, one most appropriate to Western classical music and, to a lesser extent, Anglo-American popular music. This view holds that meter “in music” consists of (1) hierarchically arranged beats (2) whose durations are nominally equivalent and (3) whose onsets among coordinated musicians are nominally aligned. This course examines rhythm and meter by interrogating three components of the standard view of the topic. Looking at Western classical music, but also traditional and commercial music from Africa and the African diaspora, we will explore the nature of meter and rhythm in music where durations might not be arranged hierarchically, of equal length, or aligned.",,,rhythm pertain experience measure duration music meter pertain cyclic organization music duration hegemonic view meter emerge music theory related discipline mid century appropriate western classical music less extent anglo american popular music view hold meter music consist hierarchically arrange beat duration nominally equivalent onset coordinate musician nominally align course examine rhythm meter interrogate component standard view topic look western classical music traditional commercial music africa african diaspora explore nature meter rhythm music duration arrange hierarchically equal length align,MUAC 3023,MUAC

If so, how are they related to natural properties? Do moral properties exist independent of human agency, or do we construct morality? If moral properties exist, how can we come to have justified belief about them? Is it possible to know that a moral belief is true? Doesn't the phenomenon of widespread, intractable disagreement about moral matters establish that there are no objective moral truths? Is the process of gaining scientific knowledge really that different from the process of gaining moral knowledge?

PHIL 2005 Philosophy of Religion (4 Credits),"What is God? Can God be known or is faith precisely a relationship to something that cannot be known in the ordinary sense? What is the relationship between God and morality? Between God and science? Is it more reasonable to believe that your religion is the only path to God or more reasonable to believe that God is manifest in many ways across different cultures? Is it reasonable to believe in God at all? If it is reasonable to believe in God, what are the reasons? And if believing in God is not based on reasons in the ordinary sense, are there philosophical grounds for believing in God anyway? This course takes a ""God friendly"" approach to philosophical questions about religion, setting out to investigate ontological and epistemological questions about belief-in-God toward the goal of understanding different ways that philosophers over the years have philosophically gone about developing, upholding, and talking about relationship with God. The course includes consideration of philosophers from analytic and continental traditions, from American and European schools of thought, from ancient, medieval, modern and post-modern traditions, and from Greek, Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions.

PHYS 3350 Physics and Information (4 Credits),"Students in Physical Sciences are often well versed in the art of model building but less so in the process of model-selection when multiple models can describe the same data. Students rarely learn tools beyond curve fitting and least square error minimization for model selection. Consequently, students are often unaware of the scope of different tools and fail to make judicious choice of algorithms/theories when faced with diverse problems. For example, building a model from data is very different from generating data (stochastic or deterministic) from a model. Next consider two contrasting challenges of model building i) when there is limited data vs ii) when there is too much data. For the first problem -- inferring models from limited data -- the solution can be traced back to Boltzmann's formulation of Statistical Physics describing motion of atoms. The connection between Information theory, Inference and Boltzmann's description, however, is often overlooked in introductory or even advanced classes in Physics, and Statistics. Studying these similarities can unlock novel solutions for problems well outside of thermodynamics, even as far as Image processing, Biology and Network science. Inference also requires us to appreciate fundamental topics in Probability -- difference between frequentist and non-frequentist approach, Bayesian formalism -- that are rarely taught to physical scientists, life scientists or engineers. At the other extreme, faced with data deluge, we routinely ask: how do we make sense of too much data ? We use clustering, PCA, Neural Networks. In this course we will discuss and connect all these seemingly disparate concepts and apply them -- at the appropriate context -- to diverse problems in Physics, Chemistry, Biology and beyond. In the process we will gain an in-depth knowledge about commonly heard but perhaps less understood topics such as: Entropy, Likelihood maximization, Bayesian statistics, PCA, Classification algorithms, and Neural Networks. We will also address another often overlooked but fundamental and fascinating topic, biology's inherent ability to encode and decode information. Currently there is no such course that address all these topics in Information and Data Science in an unified manner -- deeply connecting their formal basis, regime of applicability -- grounded on physical principles, with a forward looking approach towards application in many areas well outside of traditional sciences. A lot of learning in the course will happen `on the fly', where the tools and application problems are learnt as needed. Prerequisites: Calculus I, Calculus II, and at least two other courses focusing on application of mathematics to problems in physics/chemistry/biology or engineering. Example of this course can be University Physics, Modern Physics, Biostatistics, Differential Equation, Linear Algebra, Computational Physics, or other equivalent courses (upon Instructor approval).",,,student physical science verse art model building process model selection multiple model describe data student rarely learn tool curve fitting square error minimization model selection consequently student unaware scope different tool fail judicious choice algorithms theory face diverse problem example build model datum different generate datum stochastic deterministic model consider contrast challenge model building limited datum datum problem inferring model limited datum solution trace boltzmann formulation statistical physics describe motion atom connection information theory inference boltzmann description overlook introductory advanced class physics statistic study similarity unlock novel solution problem outside thermodynamic far image processing biology network science inference require appreciate fundamental topic probability difference frequentist non frequentist approach bayesian formalism rarely teach physical scientist life scientist engineer extreme face datum deluge routinely ask sense datum use cluster pca neural network course discuss connect seemingly disparate concept apply appropriate context diverse problem physics chemistry biology process gain depth knowledge commonly hear understand topic entropy likelihood maximization bayesian statistic pca classification algorithm neural network address overlook fundamental fascinating topic biology inherent ability encode decode information currently course address topic information data science unified manner deeply connect formal basis regime applicability ground physical principle forward look approach application area outside traditional science lot learning course happen fly tool application problem learn need prerequisite calculus calculus course focus application mathematic problem physics chemistry biology engineering example course university physics modern physics biostatistic differential equation linear algebra computational physics equivalent course instructor approval,PHYS 3350,PHYS

RLGS 3086 The Emergence of Monotheism (4 Credits),"This course is cross-listed with JUST 3086. Monotheism, the belief in a singular deity, did not arise out of nothing. Rather, the emergence of monotheism was a multi-stage process spanning several millennia and involving numerous religious traditions, primarily Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This process was marked by internal and external conflict, as individuals and communities struggled to distinguish themselves from their non-monotheistic predecessors and neighbors, while often attempting to convince others to do the same. In this class, we begin with the ancient Near Eastern religious environment in which the idea of monotheism first appeared, then turn our attention to how the movement toward monotheism shapes the texts of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, and Quran. We also look to archaeological sites and case studies in material culture to fill out our understanding of the lived experiences at play in the emergence of monotheism.",JUST 3086,,course cross list monotheism belief singular deity arise emergence monotheism multi stage process span millennia involve numerous religious tradition primarily judaism christianity islam process mark internal external conflict individual community struggle distinguish non monotheistic predecessor neighbor attempt convince class begin ancient near eastern religious environment idea monotheism appear turn attention movement monotheism shape text hebrew bible new testament quran look archaeological site case study material culture fill understanding live experience play emergence monotheism,RLGS 3086,RLGS

RLGS 2116 American Mythology (4 Credits),"Myths convey social and moral values. Myths, moreover, serve as conceptual models for society and furnish ""symbolic articulation of the social patterns"" of a given society. In this class, students will establish clear connections between social order and the myths that sustain it, against the view that myths are merely imaginary, misguided perceptions of reality with little social value. In this course, you will need to ask yourself, ""How do each of these myths translate into social behavior? In other words, how have these myths been acted out historically and how are they ""performed"" today? The United States of America has always had a strong, mythic sense of identity, mission, and destiny. It is worthwhile to reflect for a semester on how the ""idea of America"" has taken shape and is continuing to evolve and diversify. Robert Bellah introduced the influential concept of an American ""civil religion""--a secular myth of America. In addition, we must understand that America is the result of contact between at least three different groups of people: Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans. The functional equivalents of creed, scripture, prophets and religious mission are seen in the Declaration of Independence, the Founding Fathers and Manifest Destiny. Concepts of freedom, the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness, democracy, and the right to bear arms flow from these myths. Beyond the notion of a master myth of America, we will discover that there are other myths of America that are themselves proper objects of study.

Within the carceral state, the focus of the course is on the history and policies in the United States that led to the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. The course examines and moves beyond various common explanations for mass incarceration, including crime, politics, public opinion, racism and the “prison industrial complex. ” We then explore specific policies and practices that created and sustain high levels of incarceration, including sentencing, prison programing, and prosecutorial discretion, and the ways that these factors are deeply intertwined with America's history of race and inequality.

With a language like Japanese, which shares no linguistic roots with European languages, questions of translation are magnified and problematized by linguistic difference, histories of Orientalism and colonization, and fundamentally different literary aesthetics, especially in literatures of premodern Japan and early modern Europe. Questions this course considers include: with what modes of translation practice might we approach Japanese literature? How has the translation of European literature into Japanese impacted Japanese literary aesthetics and vice versa? How might we more equitably represent Japanese literature to a global Anglo audience? By what processes does the business of translation occur and how do those processes impact the actual production of literary canon and study?

SPAN 2802 Afro-Latinos in the US (4 Credits),"Afro-Latin@s (Afro-Latinos and Afro-Latinas) is a group designation for a community that, until recently, had not tended to call itself, or to have been called, in that way. The group’s past, however, demonstrates a sense of tradition and shared social and cultural realities, and the term is increasingly being used in the twenty-first century. Particular to the USA context, as opposed to Latin American countries, is that here the Afro-Latin@ experience has to do with the cross-cultural relation between the Afro and the Latin@, which means most conspicuously the relation between Latin@s and African Americans. It is important, however, not to limit the concept to that connection and recognize the presence of a group that embodies both at once. This class explores the history of Afro-Latin@s in the USA, as well as examples of unique lived experiences of Afro-Latin@ individuals navigating their social identities as they intersect with other Blacks and Latin@s. The identity field linking Black Latin Americans and Latin@s across national and regional lines will remain within focus.

THEA 2230 Movement and Voice for Actors (4 Credits),"Actors often learn movement and vocal training separately, despite the fact that speaking is a physical act and that an actor’s voice and body are constantly working in relationship to each other. This course has two main objectives: 1) to train your actor instrument through rigorous physical and vocal training, and 2) to help you understand the essential and dynamic relationship between an actor’s breath, body, and voice. You’ll explore how physical actor training strengthens and improves the ability to speak while ultimately allowing you to embody a character more successfully. Drawing from many areas of study in movement and voice, you will connect physical and vocal action through a series of exercises and explorations. Specifically, we’ll investigate 1) how to prepare your body for performance circumstances and to successfully support your vocal needs, and 2) how your body and voice can work symbiotically during performance to deliver a more powerful, precise, engaging performance. The course will begin with extensive physical and vocal actor training; then we’ll apply this training to specific theatrical texts; it will culminate in a collaborative performance that will provide opportunities for both individual and group performances. This work will strengthen stage presence and characterization and will heighten your emotional and physical power and commitment to each moment onstage. By the end of the quarter, if you do the work, you will be vocally and physically transformed, armed with a new approach to moving and speaking onstage. This course counts toward the Analytical Inquiry: Society and Culture requirement.",,,actor learn movement vocal training separately despite fact speak physical act actor voice body constantly work relationship course main objective train actor instrument rigorous physical vocal training help understand essential dynamic relationship actor breath body voice explore physical actor training strengthen improve ability speak ultimately allow embody character successfully draw area study movement voice connect physical vocal action series exercise exploration specifically investigate prepare body performance circumstance successfully support vocal need body voice work symbiotically performance deliver powerful precise engaging performance course begin extensive physical vocal actor training apply training specific theatrical text culminate collaborative performance provide opportunity individual group performance work strengthen stage presence characterization heighten emotional physical power commitment moment onstage end quarter work vocally physically transform armed new approach move speak onstage course count analytical inquiry society culture requirement,THEA 2230,THEA
